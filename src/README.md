- Individual room selection per passenger
- Real-time pricing calculation
- Child with bed/without bed pricing options

#### üí∞ **Advanced Pricing System**

#### üîÑ **Backend Integration Ready**
All components are prepared for API integration with clear comments:

```javascript
// Replace with API calls:
// - getTourById(tourId)
// - getCostDetails(tourId) 
// - getAvailableDates(tourId)
// - processPayment(paymentData)
```

### Backend Integration Tasks Needed:

#### 1. **API Endpoints to Create**
```
GET /api/tours/{tourId} - Get tour details
GET /api/tours/{tourId}/cost - Get cost details
GET /api/tours/{tourId}/dates - Get available dates
POST /api/bookings - Create booking
POST /api/payments - Process payment
GET /api/packages - Get all packages for search/filters
```

#### 2. **Database Schema Mapping**
The frontend is already aligned with your Java backend models:
- `CostMaster` ‚Üí Frontend pricing system
- `Passenger` ‚Üí Frontend passenger forms
- `BookingHeader` ‚Üí Frontend booking flow

#### 3. **Authentication Integration**
- Connect login/signup to Spring Security endpoints
- Implement JWT token management
- Add protected routes for booking process

#### 4. **Search & Filter Enhancement**
- Connect search functionality to backend package queries
- Implement category filtering
- Add location-based search

#### 5. **Payment Gateway Integration**
- Integrate Razorpay/Stripe with your Spring Boot backend
- Add order management system
- Implement booking confirmation flow
